/*
    This program will calculate the number of potions that can be made from various ingredients.
    It will ask the user which potion they want to prioritize, and then calculate the number of potions that can be made of that type.
    It will then calculate the number of potions that can be made of the other type.
    It will ask the user to input the number of ingredients they have and then calculate the number of potions that can be made.
    The program will make sure the user inputs all valid numbers, and will ask them to re-enter the number if it is invalid.
    Finally, it will output the number of mana or health potions that can be made. (The potion they prioritized will be calculated first.)
